Linking or adding a **Student** while adding its **Parent** is possible only when **a Parent already exists** in the system.

1. When the **first Parent** is added for the first time, it’s mandatory to add at least **1 Child**.
2. When a **Student** is added for the first time, it’s mandatory to add at least **1 Parent**.

So yes, you can **link** or **add** a **Student** user while adding a (second) **Parent**.  
To do this, click the **“Link or Add Children”** button while adding a Parent.
