You can set up the **availability** of an Activity inside a Container while creating that Activity.

![Availability setup and preview](/help/3-5-1.jpg)

Here you can set days for specific Activities:

**a.** The same Activities will be provided on their specified days throughout the duration of the Activity Container.

For example, if an Activity (say **Football**) happens on **Monday**, and the Container lasts **one month**, then Football will be scheduled on **all Mondays** within that month.

**b.** You can add details such as **Grades**, **Location**, **Capacity**, **Gender**, **Staff**, etc., for each Activity on a selected day.

**c.** A live **Schedule Preview** is shown on the right side to help you verify your setup.
