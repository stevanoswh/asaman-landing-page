**a.** If you can’t log in to your ASAMAN Super Admin account, please check:

Has the ASAMAN team sent you an email, a temporary password, and a login link? And have you ever logged in to your account?

If **yes**, did you reset your password when you logged in for the first time?

If **not**, please contact the ASAMAN team and ask them to send you the email, the temporary password, and the login link.

**b.** If you received the login details from the ASAMAN team and already set a password but still can’t log in, go to the login screen and click the **“Forgotten Password”** button. Then enter your email and check your email for the **“Password Reset”** link.
